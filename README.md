1. **Caution**: This page is a tool designed to assist users in accessing content from a specific site more easily. The user assumes full responsibility for any outcomes that result from using this tool.

2. **Usage Method 1: Entering a Number**
   1) After entering the correct number and clicking the confirm button, you will be able to access the corresponding content.
   2) If an incorrect number is entered, either no content will be displayed or incorrect content may appear.
   3) Clicking the random button and then the confirm button may display content if a correct number is entered by chance.

3. **Usage Method 2: Selecting Author and Language**
   1) Enter the author's name. Spaces between words should be replaced with underscores (_), and the last space will be ignored.
   2) Select a language. If "all" is selected, all language versions of the author's content will be accessible.
   3) Currently, only "Korean" and "English" are supported. The default value is Korean.

4. **Usage Method 3: Tag Input**
   1) You can navigate to the page via the "Tag Manager" button at the bottom of the page.
   2) You can combine various tags to search for works.
   3) Clicking a tag once will turn it green, meaning the tag will be included in the search.
   4) Clicking a tag twice will turn it red, meaning the tag will be excluded from the search.
   5) Clicking a red tag again will remove it from the selection.
   6) For language and content type tags, you can select only one tag per category. However, multiple exclusions are allowed. Example: You cannot search for both Korean and Japanese, but you can exclude both and search for other options.
   7) Tag combinations can be saved as presets, and they will be retained until the browser cache is cleared, even if you close the window. Modifying saved presets is not supported, so if you need to make changes, please save it as a new preset.
   8) The currently supported tags are 'broad' and 'relatively mainstream' preferences as envisioned by the creator. The goal is to avoid excessively detailed tag searches. (Example: Instead of separate tags for dog or cat anthropomorphs, these are grouped under the broader 'anthropomorph' tag.)
   9) Tags that could apply to both male and female audiences are color-coded. Tags inherently related to gender, such as yaoi or yuri, are marked in black. In cases where the creator believes a tag should lean towards a specific gender, such as male, the default will be set to female and marked in black.
   10) A feature for adding personal tags will not be developed. While user feedback may result in tag additions upon release, excessive additions will be avoided until a filtering system within tags is implemented.


5. **Known Issue (No Plan to Fix)**
    1) After entering a number and navigating to the content, if you enter a different number and navigate again, the previous page's number may briefly appear in the input field. This does not affect the actual functionality, so it will not be fixed.
